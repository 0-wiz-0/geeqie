A brief overview for those that wish to work with the source.

The Makefiles and configure script are generated by the autogen.sh script, usually
only distributed with snapshot releases. Running autogen.sh requires automake
and autoconf. GNU gettext may also be needed by autogen.sh.

CVS commits _require_ a ChangeLog entry, commits without a ChangeLog will be reverted.

Translators create a translation by creating the appropriate .po file in the /po
directory. Please see the gettext info pages for an overview and instructions.
Basically: Add your language code to the   ALL_LINGUAS=   line in configure.in,
then get started translating the strings in your ??.po file.
Note: The strings for debug output is intentionally not marked for translation.
