This is Geeqie, a successor of GQview.

Geeqie has been forked from GQview project, because it was not 
possible to contact gqview author and the only maintainer. 
Geeqie projects goal is to move the development forward and 
also integrate the existing patches.

Geeqie is currently in alpha state. Everybody is encouraged 
to try the new features, however for stable software look at 
the original project.

!!! FIXME Geeqie changes !!!
   	
    Below are GQView releases:
    (2.1.5) Add support for color profiles when lcms is installed. To
    disable color profiles and use of lcms, run configure
    with '--without-lcms'.

    (2.1.1) Add support for viewing jpeg images and EXIF embedded within
    raw files for Canon (.crw, .cr2) Fujifilm (.raf), and Nikon (.nef).
    Note that not all cameras that support a raw format will necessarily
    save a usable jpeg in the raw file (for example some Nikon cameras only
    store a tiny thumbnail within the raw .nef file).

    (1.5.6) The "shared thumbnail cache" is a proposal to unify the method
    of storing thumbnails, so that they are compatible between different
    applications. Using this option will allow GQview to share it's
    thumbnails with, and use thumbnails from, other applications. Current
    releases of GNOME (through nautilus and gthumb) and the gimp use this
    new thumbnailing system. The latest draft of the thumbnail standard
    is located on freedesktop.org in the standards section, and links to:

      http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html

    The shared thumbnail standard and GQview's classic mechanism can
    not be used at the same time, enabling the "use shared thumbnail cache"
    option will disable the use of classic thumbnails and use the new
    shared thumbnails.

    (1.5.6) Collections contained in $HOME/.gqview/collections are now
    updated when moving or renaming files, even if the collection is not
    open at the time.

    (1.5.6) The new option to the keep the full screen window above other
    windows is only available when using at least GTK+ 2.4.0

    (1.5.5) Dialog buttons are now ordered as recommended by the GNOME HIG.
    The GNOME Human Interface Guidelines live at:
       http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/
    To restore the old button order you must be using GTK 2.6 and set
    the "gtk-alternative-button-order" key to TRUE in the gtkrc file:
       $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0
    by changing or adding this line:
       gtk-alternative-button-order = 1

    (1.5.5) The dithering option is now a hidden option, to change it
    please refer to section 10.7 of the manual (help -> contents).

    (1.5.0) Keywords and comments can now be entered for a file. Two places
    allow keyword and comment entry. The first is via the new image details
    sidebar accessed with (Ctrl-K), and the second is a details tab in the
    properties dialog. If multiple files are selected, two buttons are
    available: One allows adding the keywords to the selected files, the
    other replaces existing keywords with the new keywords.

    Keyword and comment metadata is stored in $(HOME)/.gqview/metadata, and
    mirrors the existing filesystem tree. Metadata filenames have a suffix
    of .meta appended. If 'cache into .thumbnails' is enabled, metadata is
    stored locally to the original file in a hidden subfolder ".metadata".
    If write permissions do not allow local saving of metadata, GQview falls
    back to the default $(HOME)/.gqview/metadata location.

    (1.5.0) Search dialog (F3 key) types:
       Path       searches files in the entered folder.
       Comments   searches all file metadata stored in ~/.gqview/metadata.
       Results    searches the current list of results, allowing refinement.

    (1.3.6) Drag and drop has been significantly improved, with a few
    changes. Button 1 will now initiate a drag, button 2 will still work
    for this, the difference is button 2 will not change the selection.

    (1.3.6) A middle button click will now toggle selection of clicked item.

    (1.3.5) UTF-8 and filenames: GQview works fine if your filenames
    correctly match the preferred locale encoding (LANG environment
    variable), and prints errors on the console when they do not.

    (1.3.3) Safe delete does not include undo, you will need to go to the
    trash folder and retrieve the file(s) manually. The files can be viewed
    by clicking the view button near the safe delete option in the preferences
    window. Files moved to the trash folder are prefixed with a 6 digit
    number. Lower numbers are older, and deleted (permanently) first when the
    trash size limit is reached.

    (1.3.2) New in 1.3.2 are sidebars for EXIF data display and a sort
    manager. EXIF (ctrl + E) should be self explanatory. The Sort manager is a
    directory list that allows copying or moving the displayed image to that
    destination with one click of the button - very helpful when visually
    sorting many images into subdirectories. To edit, reorder, or remove items
    in the sort list, use the right click menu. The keyboard can also be used
    by moving the focus to the desired button, then pressing menu/ctrl+f10 key
    to display the popup menu, or shift+up/shift+down keys to change the
    button location in the list. Items can also be added to the list by
    dragging a directory onto the list.

  Code hackers:

    If you plan on making any major changes to the code that will be offered
    for inclusion to the main source, please contact us first - so that we
    can avoid duplication of effort. A good example is porting any part of
    GQview that uses deprecated widgets to GTK2 widgets, there are already
    several such patches floating around. This is especially true if the
    change is listed in the TODO!

======== Installation

  Compilation: ./configure ; make
  General install: make install
  Removal: make uninstall

!!! FIXME !!!
    - To build an RPM binary:

         on RedHat 6.x, 7.x use 'rpm -tb gqview-x.x.x.tar.gz'.
         on RedHat 8 and 9 use 'rpmbuild -tb gqview-x.x.x.tar.gz'.
         on other rpm distros, it depends on which version of rpm is used, if
         the option fails with the rpm command, try rpmbuild.

      Where the resulting package is placed is distribution specific, for
      example in RedHat it is placed in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/{architecture}/

======== Editor command macros                               [section:editors]

 Any one of the following filename markers may be used:

    %f  Replaced with list of selected files, may occur once.
    %p  Command is run once for each selected file, may occur multiple times.
   
 Use of the following to display output window for the command:

    %v  Display result of command in output window, must occur as first two
        characters in the command, or immediately after the "%w" macro.
    %V  Like v above, but when used with %p, only displays output window for
        multiple files. The output of a single file is suppressed.

 Additional macros:

    %w  Prevent full screen from deactivating when command is executed,
        must occur as the first two characters.

    %%  This will be replaced by one '%'. This is the way to escape '%'.

    %d  This only makes sense for external commands like copy or move as this
        is replaced by the destination.

======== Overlay Info                                        [section:overlay]

Overlay info format string syntax is: %tag[:max_length][:extra]%

  %name%       Filename of the picture.
  %collection% Name of the collection

  To access exif data use the exif name:
  %Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal%	Date of the original shot

  Pre-formatted exif data is also available:
  formatted.Camera              Camera and sofware name
  formatted.DateTime            Image Date
  formatted.ShutterSpeed        Shutter speed in seconds (ie. 1/60s)
  formatted.Aperture            Aperture (ie. f5.6)
  formatted.ExposureBias        Exposure bias (ie. +0.3)
  formatted.ISOSpeedRating      ISO sensitivity (ie. 100)
  formatted.FocalLength         Focal length
  formatted.FocalLength35mmFilm Focal length 35mm
  formatted.SubjectDistance     Subject distance
  formatted.Flash               Flash
  formatted.Resolution          Resolution
  formatted.ColorProfile        Color profile

  You can limit the length of displayed data using :number notation:
  %formatted.Camera:20% will truncate the displayed data to 20 characters
  and will add 3 dots at the end to denote the truncation.

  If two or more variables are connected with the |-sign, it prints available
  variables with a separator:
  %formatted.ShutterSpeed%|%formatted.ISOSpeedRating%|%formatted.FocalLength%
  could show:
    "1/20s - 400 - 80 mm"
  or
    "1/200 - 80 mm" if there's no ISO information in the Exif data.

  If a line is empty, it is removed.
  This allows to add lines that totally disappear when no data is available.

  Extra string uses special character '*' to mark the position of the data.
  If no '*' is present, then extra string is just appended to data.
  Any "\n" is replaced by a newline on display.
  Pango mark up is accepted in left and right parts.
  If data is empty, nothing will be displayed.

  Examples:
  "%name:<i>*</i>\n%" -> name is displayed in italics ended with a newline
  "%size:\n%"         -> size is displayed with a newline at end
  "%formatted.ISOSpeedRating:ISO *%"      -> ie. "ISO 100"
  "Collection <b>*</b>\n" -> display collection name in bold prefixed by
                             "Collection " and a newline is appended


======== Additional comments:

  Hidden options:
    These options are not adjustable in the preferences window, to change
    them edit $(HOME)/.geeqie/geeqierc while Geeqie is not running. An option
    becomes 'hidden' when it is removed from the user's visibility, and
    only remains so that those few users that really want it will not complain
    about it's removal :)

  lazy_image_sync: false
    Set true to enable the old behavior of lazy image updates when changing
    directories. (viewed image will remain until a new file is selected)

  display_dialogs_under_mouse: false
    Set true to force dialogs to display under the current mouse position,
    note that this goes against the preference set for the window manager.
