TODO key: d = done, w = work in progress, ? = possibly fixed, * = wt? - how?

d>try gtk_container_remove instead of reparent, to try to fix dragging hang.
d>After dragging files, check if they are now gone (moved).
 >Remember previous directory used in move/copy dialogs.

Major:
----------------------------------------------
d>Fix window resizing to start-up size when window is made smaller, then an
  image is changed, or widget is 'operated'.
d>Fix hang (endless gtk loop on drags in GTK+ 1.2.3) bah, in gdb its a pain,
  breaking it within the error causes a stuck pointer grab :-/
  HOW TO REPEAT:
   enable 'save tool state'
   set the tools to float
   exit
   restart
   unfloat tools
   try to do drag and drop -> BOOM!
  UPDATE: I dunno, this still looks like a gtk bug?

Minor:
----------------------------------------------
 >add a read-ahead buffer for next image, note that this will not be threaded.
 >add command line option to invoke full screen and slideshow on startup
 >make *'s const, where appropriate ()
 >make Escape cancel dialogs.

 >add progress dialog when moving/copying/deleting multiple files.
 >.xbm file format not listed by default? .pnm, more?

 >ability to specify view window background color
 >show wait cursor during image load

Wishlist?:
----------------------------------------------
 >image list, like playlist in sound players
 >add vert drag bar
 >make *.jpg on command line show only jpg files, for ex.
