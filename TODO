TODO key: d = done, w = work in progress, ? = possibly fixed
          * = required before next release

Major:
----------------------------------------------

 > pixbuf-renderer.c:
   > tile dispose order is slightly incorrect, furthest ones from current position should be dropped first


 > image.c:
  d> test and probably fix delay_flip.
      > UPDATE: works as before (pre pixbuf-renderer), but should be fixed to provide a single redraw
        by pre-rendering any scaled tiles that are visible before signaling 'render_complete'.
   > make this a g_object with signals for completed, changed, etc.
   > fix delay flip 'completed' signal (full screen busy cursor is not always turned off)

 > cache-load.c:
   > should honor enable_thumbnails setting

  ---

 >raw + exif formats:

   > all thats left to do is possibly mmap the file so we have all the tiff data available when
     looking for the make TIFF tag (0x10f) as it may not always fit within data available from
     the first read() in image-load.c.

  d> make a generic tiff header and directory parser from the nikon parser for use by all raw
     parsers that involve tiff.

  d> clean up canon parser (there are now many convenience utils to simplify tiff header, etc.):
     d> canon_read_int can be substituted with, or wrap exif_get_int16/32.
     d> CR2 tiff code can now use exif_tiff_directory_offset.

  d> support olympus MakerNote, investigate RAW (raw embedded jpeg appears to be tiny).
   > support konica / minolta MakerNote, investigate RAW.

   > exif.c parser should not be using EXIF tags during tiff directory search for EXIF tag.

  ---

 > work on pan view:
   > Pick a better keyboard shortcut than Control + J :)
  w> Fix search scrolling to try to center image and info popup.
   > Fix info popup location to opposing horizontal side when near edge of grid.
   > Find something to do with middle mouse clicks.
   > should delete key actually work?
   > search should highlight all matching images (with toggle?)
   > should non-thumbnail images have a drop shadow?
  d> optimize pixbuf_draw_line (line endpoints should clip to draw region before draw loop)
     > introduced bug (looks like clamp or rounding error)
  d> optimize pixbuf_draw_triangle
     > introduced bug (round error?)
   > check ref counting of image when redrawing after finish loading
  d> speed up sorting image.. stage when sorting/merging cache list

   > add control to toggle 'ignore folder symlinks'
   > the folder tree should not have to be re-read when changing options
     that do not effect the file list count/contents

   > time line view:
    w> allow use of file date or EXIF (embedded) date.
     > allow horizontal _or_ vertical orientation.

   > calendar view:
    w> fix search. (UPDATE: still can not find day containing name/path/partial)
     > supports thumbnail size images only, should grey out actual size items in size menu or something...
    w> allow use of file date or EXIF (embedded) date.
     > fix scrolling when 'day' popup appears outsize of canvas.

   > grid view:
     > allow sorting by name, date, size, dimensions, etc.

   > flower view:
    d> do not show empty folders

   > under consideration:
     > split view

  ---

d> fix window size hints not to use USER_SIZE as we do not use gtk_window_resize to set the hint's attribute, and
   apparently GTK passes in unitialized values for this case (definite programming error, but also a GTK bug?).

 > the info dialog is not set as a transient of the calling window, this causes it to be behind
   a full screen window when 'stay above other windows' is enabled.

 > folder tree view shortcuts for expanding/collapsing leak through to the main
   window (+,-,*,/, etc.), figure what behavior is desired and fix this.

 -------------

d> update translations: it(x) ( ) ( )

 > document recent additions/changes:
   > Added 'Fast jpeg thumbnailing'.
   > xvpics is now hidden option.
   > Holding down shift will now scroll more when panning with mouse.


Minor (non blockers):
----------------------------------------------

 > when resizing/refreshing collection window, keep the same top left thumbnail visible

 > do not lose slideshow when reworking window layout.

 > add toolbar to: (UPDATE: these toolbars may not make it into 1.6)
   > find dupes window (with button to open dialog to add new files/folders)
   > collection window
   > search window

Wishlist?:
----------------------------------------------

 > Initiating full screen from the command line should not
   show main window until full screen is exited.

 > Add shortcut to jump to next folder within parent folder.

 > add animated image support

 > add gamma correction patch

 > deleting a file should not discontinue slide show.

 > add option to only preload max # of thumbnails (to conserve memory),
   then release old/load new needed thumbnails on demand.

 > printing (low priority):
   > fix text postscript output by converting utf8 to a locale (better) understood by postscript...
   > allow selection of background color... (for image files only?)...
   > allow text color and font selection

 > image comparison window (displays two or more images for comparison)

 > add symlink option (in addition to the move/copy stuff.)

 > allow slideshow transition effects (wipe/fade etc.)

 > allow on the fly slideshow delay change with [,] and [.] (< and > too?)
   > show change in overlay for image...
   > account for changing of imd when toggling full screen...
   > should change be only to current slideshow?
