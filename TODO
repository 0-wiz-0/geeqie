TODO key: d = done, w = work in progress, ? = possibly fixed
          * = required before next release

Major:
----------------------------------------------

 > work on pan view:
   > Pick a better keyboard shortcut than Control + J :)
  d> Add warning dialog that it will be slow if the standard thumbnail cache is not enabled.
   > Fix occasional redraw bugs when zoomed out.
   > Fix occasional odd requests for non-visible tiles when zoomed out (related to above?).
   > Fix slowness in image.c with huge grid size by changing use of pre-allocated tile array
     to on-demand tile allocation (can this be implemented like source tiles?).
     OR: use an array so that we do not need to walk a GList of pre-allocated tile containers
  w> Fix search scrolling to try to center image and info popup.
   > Fix info popup location to opposing horizontal side when near edge of grid.
   > Find something to do with middle mouse clicks.
  d> Set drag and drop data to clicked image.
  d> Should the copy/move/rename/delete operations be available here?
   > ^ and if so, should delete key actually work?
  d> searching for same item more than once should step through all matches
   > search should highlight all matching images (with toggle?)
   > should non-thumbnail images have a drop shadow?

   > time line view:
    d> searching by date should scroll to proper alignment with year/month/day boundaries.

   > calendar view:
    w> fix search. (UPDATE: still can not find day containing name/path/partial)
     > supports thumbnail size images only, should grey out actual size items in size menu or something...

   > grid view:
     > allow sorting by name, date, size, dimensions, etc.

   > flower view:
     > fix it :)

 > the info dialog is not set as a transient of the calling window, this causes it to be behind
   a full screen window when 'stay above other windows' is enabled.

d> use doubles instead of floats wherever possible

 -------------

 > update translations: ( ) ( ) ( )

 > document recent additions/changes:
   > Added 'Fast jpeg thumbnailing'.
   > xvpics is now hidden option.
   > Holding down shift will now scroll more when panning with mouse.


Minor (non blockers):
----------------------------------------------

 > when resizing/refreshing collection window, keep the same top left thumbnail visible

 > do not lose slideshow when reworking window layout.

 > add toolbar to: (UPDATE: these toolbars may not make it into 1.6)
   > find dupes window (with button to open dialog to add new files/folders)
   > collection window
   > search window


Wishlist?:
----------------------------------------------

 > Initiating full screen from the command line should not
   show main window until full screen is exited.

 > add animated image support

 > add gamma correction patch

 > deleting a file should not discontinue slide show.

 > add option to only preload max # of thumbnails (to conserve memory),
   then release old/load new needed thumbnails on demand.

 > printing (low priority):
   > fix text postscript output by converting utf8 to a locale (better) understood by postscript...
   > allow selection of background color... (for image files only?)...
   > allow text color and font selection

 > image comparison window (displays two or more images for comparison)

 > add symlink option (in addition to the move/copy stuff.)

 > allow slideshow transition effects (wipe/fade etc.)

 > allow on the fly slideshow delay change with [,] and [.] (< and > too?)
   > show change in overlay for image...
   > account for changing of imd when toggling full screen...
   > should change be only to current slideshow?
