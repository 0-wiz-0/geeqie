      Result dialog
    </title>
    <para>
      Commands that are set to display their output in a window will show a dialog when the command is executed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Result dialog will display the command's text output. If the editor command will result in multiple runs of the same command for each file, you can use the Stop button to stop Geeqie from executing the command for remaining files.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once all commands have completed, or if the Stop button was pressed and the pending command has completed, you can use the Close button, or press Escape, to close the Result dialog. The Result dialog can not be closed while a command is still running.
