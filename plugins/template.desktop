# %f	 A single file name, even if multiple files are selected. The
# system reading the desktop entry should recognize that the program in
# question cannot handle multiple file arguments, and it should should
# probably spawn and execute multiple copies of a program for each
# selected file if the program is not able to handle additional file
# arguments. If files are not on the local file system (i.e. are on HTTP
# or FTP locations), the files will be copied to the local file system and
# %f will be expanded to point at the temporary file. Used for programs
# that do not understand the URL syntax.
# 
# %F	A list of files. Use for apps that can open several local files
# at once. Each file is passed as a separate argument to the executable
# program.
# 
# %u	A single URL. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs or
# as file path.
# 
# %U	A list of URLs. Each URL is passed as a separate argument to
# the executable program. Local files may either be passed as file: URLs
# or as file path.

# "$GEEQIE_DESTINATION" destination set by Geeqie
Exec=ln -s %f "$GEEQIE_DESTINATION"

# Desktop files that are usable only in Geeqie should be marked like this:
Categories=X-Geeqie;
OnlyShowIn=X-Geeqie;

# Show in menu "File"
X-Geeqie-Menu-Path=FileMenu/FileOpsSection

# This is a filter - $GEEQIE_DESTINATION is required
X-Geeqie-Filter=true

# It can be made verbose
# X-Geeqie-Verbose=true
