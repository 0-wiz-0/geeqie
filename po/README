Translators create a translation by creating the appropriate .po file in the /po
directory.

Please see the gettext info pages for an overview and instructions.

Basically:
- Add your language code to the LINGUAS file
- then get started translating the strings in your ??.po file.

Note: The strings for debug output is intentionally not marked for translation.

To update a specific translation:
- intltool-update [lang] (ie. intltool-update fr).

To update all translation files, use make update-po. You should only use it when
needed (before a release or when there were many changes in source code).


Helper scripts:

gen_translations_stats.sh	generate statistics about translations
regen_potfiles.sh		generate a patch to sync POTFILES.in with current source files
